Akshay's Corner (Website + Sphinx Theme)
===============================================================================

This repository holds the code (custom
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_ Theme) and content
for my personal portfolio website, `Akshay's Corner <https://xa.mes3.dev>`_,
which I intend to use as my primary source of teaching and sharing thoughts and
experiments.

The website and this complementary repository serves as:

- **Digital Portfolio.** Showcasing my projects in AI, ML, and Software
  Development.
- **Pedagogy.** Mostly with blogs, references, and tutorial posts sharing
  insights into AI and Open Science.

To learn more about this, visit `here <https://xa.mes3.dev>`_.
