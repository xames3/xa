Over the last few years, as I've slowly come to believe that if you really
understand a concept, now it could be anything from maths to science to even
programming, you should be able to explain it simply to anyone, **even a
five-year old**. I've said it before, I live by this old quote:

.. epigraph::

    If you want to master something, teach it.

    -- Dr Richard Feynman

But for me, that teaching needs to be practical, relatable, and, honestly, to
have a bit of a laugh sometimes. And this corner is where I'll be sharing my
take on some of those concepts that can sometimes seem a bit daunting.

I'm starting this new series as an experiment for myself, to see how much I've
learnt over the years by relating theoretical or invisible concepts to our
practical, tangible world.

    In my experience as an engineer and a professor, the biggest hurdle isn't
    the code itself, it's the **need to imagine** a complex, invisible process.

I find great joy in sharing my personal experiences as examples, because a
solid, practical analogy is like a little bridge between the confusing
technical term and a clear, simple understanding.

A complex concept can become instantly clear when you connect it to something
you see or do every single day. This idea is truly a passion of mine because it
closely aligns with my belief in making knowledge accessible, breaking down the
digital and cultural barriers that stop people from diving into the world of
technology.

Plus, I also want to give everyone the chance to understand and share their own
examples or their ways of understanding the same concepts.

You never know what simple example or idea might be the one that finally
clicks!!

.. rubric:: The big idea

Each page here will focus on a single concept, and I'll explain it simply,
using practical examples that we encounter every day. For me, the best examples
are always the ones you can see and feel.

It is always lovely when someone has a prerequisite for a topic, but I feel
that won't be necessary here, as I intend to keep these articles completely
independent. So feel free to jump in and explore whichever topic you fancy.

These pages are designed to give you that **aha!!** moment. They are short\*,
sharp bits of knowledge with relatable examples to make technical understanding
click instantly.
