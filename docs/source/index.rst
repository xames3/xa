Hello hello, I'm **Akshay**!

I currently work as an Adjunct at National Louis University. Before getting
into academia, I worked as an AI Engineering Lead. This small corner on the
internet is my space to explore and share my experiences in software
development through means of storytelling.

Here, I want to share my work (current and previous), my *"aha!!"* moments, my
moments of struggles, failures, gratitude, and my journey through the worlds
of AI, Open Source, and Software Development.

I also have a special interest in natural language processing and reinforcement
learning, so there's that to share too.

.. _open-source:

I :fas:`heart mrl-0 red` Open Source!!

Funny enough, I accidentally got started into it and I don't know why; I bloody
loved it. It was, and still is, a personal reminder to share my struggles and
achievements with everyone, breaking down cultural and digital barriers and
inviting collaboration across disciplines and borders.

My belief in this *"open-ness"* has led me to contribute to and work at some
amazing research labs and projects under the guidance of some super-duper
talented people in the industry.

In these labs, I worked on a diverse range of projects, from building
performant machine learning models to eventually crafting numerical computing
libraries. These projects (big and small) helped me reflect on both my
technical depth and my knowledge gaps.

    .. grid-item-card::

        .. repository:: xames3/slowtorch

        A subset of core PyTorch features re-built in pure Python.

    .. grid-item-card::

        .. repository:: xames3/xsnumpy

        An experimental re-implementation of a few NumPy features in Python.

Beyond these, I've had the opportunity to speak at a few tech meetups and
conferences, sharing insights on my projects, my thoughts on AI, Open Source,
and the inner workings of some frameworks.

It wouldn't be possible if I hadn't explored this; in doing so, I realised I
had a passion for teaching and sharing this.

Teaching philosophy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personally, I believe that *"true"* mastery of something comes from sharing
knowledge and learning from mistakes and past experiences. Whether it is
breaking down complex machine learning algorithms or explaining the nuances of
software design patterns, I find joy in making these technical ideas relatable
and easy to grasp.

Early in my software engineering career, I came across a quote:

.. epigraph::

    If you want to master something, teach it.

    -- Dr. Richard Feynman

And I absolutely fell in love with this idea. Soon, I realised you really
can't really call yourself an SME (`Subject-matter expert`_) until you can
teach a concept to those who barely know anything about it (or very little),
and are willing to entertain questions at that initial frame of reference.

Thus began my journey into teaching.

Although my approach to mentoring has changed and evolved over the past few
years, adapting to the needs of my environment, my students/mentees, the time,
and my position, when asked for any help, I created this website. This website
is more than my portfolio; it's a living project where I'd like the technology
and education to grow together.

Ultimately, my goal is to use this corner to bridge the gap between education,
collaboration, building tools, and sharing ideas.

Let's connect

I'm not on social media, but I'm always open to conversations about AI,
Teaching, Open Source, or just a casual chat about life. I'd love to hear from
you. It doesn't need to be just about the tech either.

Also, I'm a huge film nerd and I enjoy memes!!
