About me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Akshay, an educator, engineer, and currently a CS Adjunct Faculty at
`National Louis University`_. Before getting into academia, I worked at
consulting firms, corporate product companies, and a startup. This small corner
on the internet is my space to explore and share my experiences in software
engineering through storytelling.

I currently live in Chicago. I got my Master's in AI from `DePaul University`_
in 2025. I also have a special interest in natural language processing and
reinforcement learning.

I'm learning `Rust`_ this year.

.. _open-source:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open source.

I :fas:`heart mrl-0 red` Open source!!

I accidentally got started on it, and I don't know why; I bloody loved it.
Doing open source was, and still is, a personal reminder to share my struggles
and achievements/learnings with everyone and invite collaboration across
various disciplines.

Fortunately, this naive belief in sharing has led me to contribute to and work
at some amazing research labs and projects under the guidance of some
super-duper talented people in the industry.

In these labs, I worked on a different kinds of projects, from building
performant machine learning models to eventually crafting numerical computing
libraries. These projects and sometimes our clients (big and small) helped me
reflect on both my technical depth and my knowledge gaps.

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card::

        .. repository:: xames3/slowtorch

        A subset of core PyTorch features re-built in pure Python.

    .. grid-item-card::

        .. repository:: xames3/xsnumpy

        An experimental re-implementation of a few NumPy features in Python.

Beyond these, I've had the opportunity to speak at a few tech meetups and
conferences, sharing insights on my projects, my thoughts on AI, and the inner
workings of some frameworks.

It wouldn't be possible if I hadn't explored this; in doing so, I realised I
had a passion for teaching.

.. _teaching-philosophy:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teaching philosophy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe that "true" mastery of something comes from sharing learnings from
mistakes and past experiences. Whether it's breaking down complex machine
learning algorithms or explaining the nuances of software design patterns, I
find joy in making these technical ideas relatable and easy to grasp.

Early in my software engineering career, I came across a quote:

.. epigraph::

    If you want to master something, teach it.

    -- Dr Richard Feynman

And I absolutely fell in love with this idea. Soon, I realised you really
can't call yourself an :abbr:`SME (Subject-matter expert)` until you can teach
a concept to those who barely know anything about it (or very little), and are
willing to entertain questions at that initial frame of reference.

Thus began my journey into teaching.

Although my approach to mentoring has changed and evolved over the past few
years, adapting to the needs of my environment, my students/mentees, the time,
and my position, when asked for any help.

Let's connect.

I'm not on any social media besides `LinkedIn`_, but I'm always open to having
conversations about AI, Teaching, Open source, or just a casual chat about
life. I'm a huge film nerd and enjoy memes, so feel free to send me your
recommendations.
