In everyone's life, there are always points where you pause and look back. You
not only reflect on your achievements and/or mistakes, but also the people
who've played a role in those moments in time.

This article is that moment, where I'm looking back and paying tribute to those
people or my "guiding stars", whose wisdom, encouragement, belief, and
friendship have been a solid foundation of my growth as a teacher/mentor and a
lifelong learner. Each person mentioned here :abbr:`DOA (dead or alive)` has
left a significant mark on me.

And from the bottom of my heart, I thank you for that.

    These reflections aren't exhaustive, nor could they ever be. I've shared
    stories or incidents in very minor detail. But every single person here has
    contributed to my journey to some extent or another and I'm super grateful
    for that.

The most pivotal person in my life is my mum, **Sunita**. I often compare her
to `Gaia`_, the earth goddess, because of her uncompromising foundation upon
which I've built my dreams. Again, like Gaia, she supported and still supports
me during my highs and lows and helped shape my character.

My mum's always with me, in my moments of doubt, to celebrating my successes
(big and small); she has always been present and keeping me grounded. And to
this strength, I'm and I'll always be eternally grateful!!

.. _charlotte-parks:

Charlotte Parks

**Charlotte**, though you're no longer with us, your influence still remains
pretty strong in my life. I still remember you encouraging me to question
things deeply and to pursue understanding beyond the surface.

Now, it doesn't make any sense to say it all, but your belief in my ability to
teach and explain things planted the seed of this very platform, and
surprisingly... I still feel like we're chatting.

I know it's weird, and I totally get it. But if you were to be here today,
you'd be very proud of me. I know you always wanted me to teach, and now look
where I am. Every time I get into my *"teaching"* mode, I see your spirit
reminding me of our last chat...

.. epigraph::

    If you loved me like a man, then live your life like a man. Walk this rock
    like a man. Keep moving forward through calm and storm, I'll always be with
    you Akshay, but in a different form.

.. rubric:: Roll credits, my supporting cast
.. rubric::
    I believe that life, much like a cinema, is **never** a solo act, but in
    the collective effort of those who work behind the scenes.
    :class: subtitle-text

And so, my life or this journey has always been shaped and tweaked by an
extraordinary cast of mentors, friends, coworkers, supporters, and even
strangers, each playing an essential role in the stories I share.

Everything you read here, whether it be project ideas or teaching inspiration,
is the sum of invaluable contributions from these individuals who stood beside
me and eventually nudged me to step beyond my comfort zone.

So, this section is my version of the end credits. A heartfelt tribute to those
whose names may not always be in the spotlight, but whose impact resonates in
every lesson I pass on. And as with any good film, the credits roll long after
the story ends.

Thus, this list will continue to grow, as I'm certain there are more brilliant
minds and kind souls yet to cross my path.

.. note::

    The following list is in alphabetical order soley for clarity. Every person
    holds equal importance and has had a significant influence on my life.

.. _antonio-tovar:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antonio Tovar
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Dr Tovar`_, I first met you at `National Louis University <https://nl.edu>`_
in 2024, during the `NASA Open Science`_ workshop. You were co-leading that
cohort and generously offered me the opportunity to intern under your guidance
at NASA. You've always been kind, supportive, a father figure, and a teacher
ready with valuable advice and encouragement.

    `Ishrak Rahman`_ (centre), `Orkhan Guliyev`_ (right-centre), and
    `Sezim Mamatova`_ (right) at NASA Open Science 2025 after presentations.

There were a lot of people who helped me on my journey to becoming a teacher,
but you were perhaps the most important of them all. I can't thank you enough
for all the opportunities you've given me at NLU and for still believing in
me, Dr Tovar.

And for that, I'm deeply grateful!!

.. _cameron-riddell:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cameron Riddell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Cameron`_, you've been a true mentor and a source of inspiration in my open
science journey from the very start. Though our chats have been entirely
virtual, your mentorship has bridged time zones.

I vividly remember how your resourceful teachings offered clarity and
encouragement precisely when I needed it most. Your introduction to
`Edward Tufte`_'s work, has reshaped my approach to presenting and interpreting
data. Whenever I see a chart or someone asks me for my *"opinion"* on how to
visualise it, I always think of you and your teachings; often sharing your
videos and resources with them.

Cheers for being such a **"legend"**, mate!!

Fatemeh Taghvaei
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Fatemeh**, our paths crossed thanks to :ref:`Dr Tovar <antonio-tovar>` while
I was still a student at DePaul and you were already teaching at NLU. To me,
you're more than a colleague; you're a mentor and perhaps my greatest
well-wisher.

    Fatemeh attending my graduation ceremony alongside Young, June 2025

I still remember my first day of teaching at the uni, I was extremely nervous.
But you were there, walking me through all the things I had to do and reminding
me of my responsibilities. Besides :ref:`Young <young-song>`, you were the only
other friend who came to my graduation and celebrated till the end. For that,
I'm very grateful.

I know I give you hard time, Fatemeh, but I just have one thing to say...
Wowwwwwwww

.. _john-komarnicki:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Komarnicki
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`John`_ is the *"MC"* of `Chicago Code and Coffee`_, a monthly tech-networking
event and perhaps the largest one of all in Chicago. I first met you at one of
these events (June 2024) during a particularly difficult time in my life.

I was looking for a distraction of sorts, and it turned out to be exactly what
I needed: a supportive community that you and your team had fostered with care.
As time passed, the community has grown significantly. I became a volunteer,
and more people have found opportunities through your work.

Your efforts have created a space where people truly belong. You, my friend,
will get no strikes.

    event on `Meetup`_.

Judy Cazares
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I first met `Judy`_ at `ChiPy`_ in 2024, and you were among the first to
welcome me. Since then, we've been great friends. Your kindness and support
have always been appreciated. I've always valued your willingness to listen and
offer thoughtful, grounded advice.

I often find myself reflecting on your words surprisingly more than I've with
anyone else. Our playful banter and jokes are a highlight, yet it is amusing
how I always end up taking your advice (sooner or later) to heart. I'll always
be grateful for your time.

**PS.** I got a new humidifier.

.. _madhavi-rege:

Madhavi Rege
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Madhavi**, you've been an incredible mentor and a profound influence in my
life. Of all the people I've worked under in my software engineering journey,
you were perhaps the most critical and impactful. Looking back, I realised that
it was under your leadership that I mastered the art of time and work
management.

You nurtured my ability to think critically and execute tasks with attention to
detail. These qualities still remain with me today and into every project and
professional endeavour.

For all your coaching, I'm deeply grateful.

.. _sameer-g-mathad:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sameer  Mathad
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Sameer`_, our friendship began during my final quarter at DePaul. I often
tease you about your disciplined approach, but beneath the banter lies a
genuine admiration for your steady commitment to hard work.

    Sameer and I, June 2025 at our graduation ceremony

What I don't usually say, and perhaps I should more often, is how much I admire
your steady, **no-bullshit** approach to hard work and study. While I often
pride myself on being a mentor or a bit of a teacher now and then, there have
been moments where I've felt more like a student, learning a lesson or two from
you.

And I, for sure, look forward to many more meaningful conversations and moments
of learning together.

.. _shailesh-kewat:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shailesh Kewat
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Shailesh**, you're a true gentleman and, much like
:ref:`Mum <sunita-mestry>`, a firm pillar of support. I still remember... our
friendship began during challenging phases in our lives. Though the results
didn't always reflect our efforts, I gained and scored something far more
valuable: a lifelong friend and cherished memories.

You've stood by me through both triumphs and trials, especially after I lost my
:ref:`Charlotte <charlotte-parks>`. You encouraged me to return to teaching and
ensured I had everything I needed to overcome self-doubt. Your wisdom on public
speaking and community engagement gave me the courage to build this platform
and the confidence I carry today.

Here's 🍷 to our friendship.

.. _shilpa-musale:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shilpa Musale
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Shilpa`_, you've been my source of wisdom since my first year at the uni. At
times when I felt isolated and overwhelmed, you made me feel safe and welcomed.
Our conversations and your stories have been more than memories; they've been
life lessons, each filled with quiet wisdom.

You've guided me through career decisions and supported me during difficult
times. Your presence was always reassuring, whether through a message or a
spontaneous invitation for a walk. I'd never forget that.

I'm genuinely grateful to have found a mentor in you!!

.. _young-song:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Young Song
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Young`_, our friendship began in my second quarter at the uni, where we both
took a class on Discrete Structures. From the outset, your curiosity and
support stood out, and I'm truly grateful for the friendship we've built since
then.

    Young attending and celebrating our graduation ceremony, June 2025

One memory that remains vivid is my graduation day. My mum wasn't able to
attend, nor anyone else, and it could've been a lonely milestone. Yet you were
there for :ref:`Sameer <sameer-g-mathad>` and me, arriving early (as usual) and
staying through the entire ceremony, from the first moments at seven in the
morning until the celebrations ended late in the afternoon. You brought us
gifts and, more importantly, your unwavering presence.

In a moment that could've felt empty, you filled it with warmth and
celebration; for that, I'm very thankful, Young.
