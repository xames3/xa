As of writing this in December 2025, over the winter break, there isn't much to
do. There aren't many events happening, and it's bloody cold here in Chicago!!

.. epigraph::

    Every year, the year ends. But before it ends, it happens.

    -- Dan Toomey, `@GoodWorkMB`_

I recently came across this new trend of doing "Year in Review", so I thought
of reflecting on the past twelve months to cherish, enjoy, and relive some of
those emotions, struggles, wins, loses, and rejections.

If you know me, you know that I like to share my experiences through stories,
including the bumpy parts. So, here is my TLDR of 2025, wrapped up in a short
storyboard.

.. rubric::
    :fas:`earth-americas far` NASA SCHOOL Internship, xsNumPy and
    SlowTorch
    :class: subtitle-text

I started my internship at **NASA** in their Open Science program for the
SCHOOL project with Columbia University and `National Louis University`_. I was
almost done with :doc:`xsNumPy <../projects/xsnumpy>` and started working on
:doc:`SlowTorch <../projects/slowtorch>`. In the meantime, I also visited the
`Art Institute of Chicago`_ and the `Adler Planetarium`_.

    Both, the Art Institute and Planetarium are worth visiting and are free for
    Illinois residents.

.. rubric:: :fas:`screen-users far` NLU, Nvidia, and ChiPy
    :class: subtitle-text

I had an interview with Nvidia, which I botched, and didn't get through. Later
the same week, I interviewed at `National Louis University`_ for the CSIS
Adjunct Faculty role. :ref:`Dr Tovar <antonio-tovar>` and
:ref:`Prof. Fatemeh <fatemeh-taghvaei>` helped me prepare for the interview. By
the end of the month, I gave a `talk`_ at `ChiPy`_ about
:doc:`xsNumPy <../projects/xsnumpy>`.

.. _march-2025:

.. rubric:: :fas:`badge-check far` At last... I'm an Adjunct!!
    :class: subtitle-text

I finished my AI Master's program from `DePaul University`_. This concluded my
NASA Open Science internship with Columbia and `National Louis University`_ and
my remaining coursework. I started working on the
:ref:`backward pass <walking-backwards>` implementation
in :doc:`SlowTorch <../projects/slowtorch>`. I also got the CSIS Adjunct
Faculty role at NLU.

.. rubric:: :fas:`chalkboard-user far` Prof. Akshay, you say?!
    :class: subtitle-text

I held my first academic class this month. I had around 40 students across two
in-person sections for Introduction to Applied Programming classes. Amongst all
the other things that happened, this was the highlight of the month.

.. tip:: The thrill of teaching students felt surreal and super-duper fun!!

.. _may-2025:

May

.. rubric:: :fas:`thumbs-down far` Aah... the rejection(s)
    :class: subtitle-text

I was rejected at 2nd technical interview round at Microsoft for the Azure
Fabrics Platform Lead position. This was followed by another unusual interview
rejection at smart contracting firm. The first two interviews went well, but
the final interview with their PM was weird.

I'll just keep it at that.

.. _june-2025:

June

.. rubric:: :fas:`graduation-cap far` I finally graduated!!
    :class: subtitle-text

I graduated and walked the stage alongside :ref:`Sameer <sameer-g-mathad>`.
Oddly enough, this all happened on the same day as my father's birthday, and
he was the one who wanted me to get my master's. So, this one goes to him! I
also met someone and learnt about **All-You-Can-Eat Sushi** at this place
called `Sushi Taku`_.

.. rubric:: :fas:`heart-slash far` You win some, you lose some
    :class: subtitle-text

I went out with someone I really liked. It was a rather lovely time. I also
mentored my students at the NASA Open Science 2025 workshop at NLU. All
students did an excellent job, and I was chuffed and proud the whole time.
Unfortunately, I lost one of my ward to a car accident. I felt miserable that I
couldn't do anything but mourn.

.. rubric:: :fas:`prescription-bottle-pill far` Another loss
    :class: subtitle-text

I was trying to pick myself up from losing someone close, but this month didn't
help either. I lost one of my ex-girlfriends to substance abuse. It wasn't fair
what happened to her, nor should I be justifying anything. All I know is that
she was a great person, unfortunately, utterly mistaken for her actions, but
really a fantastic person at heart.

Zero, I'll miss you.

.. _september-2025:

September
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: :fas:`mobile far` Rejections and a new iPhone
    :class: subtitle-text

I upgraded to the latest iPhone, iPhone 17 Pro (not the Max this time), like I
always do. This is a **foolish** habit of mine and something I'd never condone.
Contrary to my deep infatuation with Apple products, I was rejected 3 times
this whole month, all at the final rounds, for 3 different AI related
positions. And I felt stupid as f*ck!!

.. _october-2025:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
October
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: :fas:`code far` Back to square one
    :class: subtitle-text

I spent most of this month not doing anything interesting. I was frustrated
with the 3 consecutive rejections from Apple. I wasted most of my time
:doc:`watching YouTube <youtube-videos>`. Accidentally, I came across this
video and wrote a webserver in Rust to keep myself engaged.

.. youtube:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GBlCinu9yg

.. seealso::

    There are a lot more videos about writing webserver in Rust, but this is
    perhaps the most easiest to follow along.

.. rubric:: :fas:`tv far` Binging The Bear
    :class: subtitle-text

I got a job offer for a Senior Cloud Engineer position at an Analytics &
Compliance company, but I had to refuse it, unfortunately. The role was
on-site, and I had to relocate to Texas, USA in a week. Apart from this, I
binged the show called `The Bear`_. It was something... brought back so many
memories.

.. note::

    The development team, HR and the Hiring manager were super supportive, but
    didn't anticipate the client's rapid requirements.

.. rubric:: :fas:`gamepad-modern far` Video games, Netflix and Chill
    :class: subtitle-text

It was bloody cold in Chicago, so going out was out of the question. I stayed
in for the most part, playing `Dragon Ball Sparking Zero`_ and `Skribbl.io`_
with my friends and some students. I also binged the whole `Stranger Things`_
from season 01 through the finale, and I was disappointed with the ending.
