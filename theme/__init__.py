"""\
Akshay's Corner Sphinx Theme
============================

Author: Akshay Mestry <xa@mes3.dev>
Created on: 21 February, 2025
Last updated on: 13 February, 2026

This module serves as the primary entry point for the Akshay's Corner
Sphinx Theme. It is responsible for initialising the theme, configuring
its extensions, and integrating with Sphinx's build process.

This module connects the theme's internal utilities and configurations
with the Sphinx application lifecycle, ensuring seamless interaction
between theme components and the final HTML output.

This theme  is registered through the `setup()` function, which
configures the theme, maps user-configurable options, and binds event
hooks for post-processing and dynamic content handling.

.. versionadded:: 21.2.2025

    [1] Added native support for `sphinx.ext-opengraph` extension.

.. versionadded:: 2.3.2025

    [1] Override styles for `sphinx_design` extension by using a
        custom CSS.
    [2] Override styles for `sphinx_docsearch` extension by using a
        custom CSS.

.. versionchanged:: 27.8.2025

    [1] Added support for `tagged` directive to overlay clickable
        face tags on images.
    [2] Added native support for injecting `last_updated` date just
        above the footer.

.. deprecated:: 19.10.2025

    [1] Use of `website_options` in favour of `html_context`. This
        removes the need of `register_website_options` function.
    [2] Custom website options are now replaced by default Sphinx's
        `html_theme_options`.

.. versionchanged:: 2.11.2025

    [1] Internals are now called Extensions, which is way more accurate
        and appropriate name for them.
    [2] The theme now registers from the `base/templates` directory
        instead of `base`, like before. This allows to make the
        development simple and easy to follow by keeping the templates
        (html/jinja2 templates) separate then the styling components.
