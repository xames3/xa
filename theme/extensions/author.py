"""\
Author Directive
================

Author: Akshay Mestry <xa@mes3.dev>
Created on: 22 February, 2025
Last updated on: 15 January, 2026

This module defines a custom `author` directive for this sphinx theme.
The directive allows embedding details directly within the document.

The `author` directive is designed to extend reStructuredText (rST)
capabilities by injecting structured metadata about the content, which
can be styled or processed further using Jinja2 templates.

The `author` directive can be used in reStructuredText documents as
follows::

    .. code-block:: rst

        .. author::
            :name: Akshay Mestry
            :avatar: https://example.com/avatar.png
            :github: https://github.com/xames3
            :timestamp: 2025-02-22

The above snippet will be processed and rendered according to the
theme's Jinja2 template, producing a final HTML output.

.. versionchanged:: 19.10.2025

    The options `author`, `email`, and `github` are now optional and can
    default to project's details specified in `conf.py`.

.. deprecated:: 19.10.2025

    Removed the custom subject header in favour of page title.

.. deprecated:: 15.01.2026

    Removed usage of Email, Bio, and LinkedIn metadata.
