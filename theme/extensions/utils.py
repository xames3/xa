"""\
Theme Utilities
===============

Author: Akshay Mestry <xa@mes3.dev>
Created on: 21 February, 2025
Last updated on: 14 January, 2026

This module defines a collection of utility functions used for
customising this sphinx theme. These utilities focus on enhancing the
post-processing of the generated HTML output, as well as providing
additional support for interactive elements, theme options, and other
dynamic behaviours.

The functionality provided includes handling collapsible table of
contents (ToC), removal of unnecessary elements, and custom event
handling for theme-specific features.

The goal of this module is to ensure that this theme produces clean,
efficient, and interactive HTML documentation by leveraging Sphinx's
internal APIs and dynamic JavaScript bindings.

.. deprecated:: 19.10.2025

    Use of `website_options` in favour of `html_context`. This removes
    the need of `register_website_options` function.
